# Bridge Configuration
# This file controls the settings for the Python TCP Bridge between Cube/Superset and MySQL.

bridge:
  # The interface to listen on (0.0.0.0 exposes it to the network)
  bind_host: "0.0.0.0" 
  # The port this bridge will listen on (to be accessed by Cube/Superset)
  bind_port: 3307 

target:
  # The actual internal MySQL Server
  host: "192.168.1.180"
  port: 3306
  # Connection timeout in seconds
  timeout: 30

security:
  # Allowed IP addresses (e.g., Cube Cloud IPs). Leave empty to allow all (NOT RECOMMENDED for production).
  # Cube Cloud Source IPs usually need to be whitelisted here if known.
  allowed_ips: []
  # Enable SSL wrapping if the target supports it but we want to terminate/re-encrypt (Advanced)
  # For now, simplistic TCP passthrough.
  ssl_enabled: false
